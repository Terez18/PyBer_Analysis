## Overview of the analysis: 
The initial analysis for PyBer included analyzing very large amounts of data to show the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, and the relationship between the percentage of total fares and riders and drivers by type of city. The purpose of this analysis was for PyBer to make informed decisions that will improve access to the ride sharing app as well as improve affordability.  

The purpose of the new analysis was to aggregate the ride sharing data by city type and to compare the results of the different city types in order to make recommendations to the decision makers at the ride sharing app company PyBer.
